## About me:

I started as power-engineer specialist, but this profession and studying disappointed me, so I decided to start a new one, Front-End Developer. Mainly, my decision based on experience I had at university. I solved a lot of algorithmic tasks on IT lessons and even started to sell my helping hand to another students for some cheap price. Now I'm trying to receive a new profession in my new college and RS School courses. I think my desire to learn will help me to pass and to success!
