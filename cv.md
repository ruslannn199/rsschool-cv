## About me:

I started as power-engineer specialist, but this profession and studying disappointed me, so I decided to start a new one, Front-End Developer. Mainly, my decision based on experience I had at university. I solved a lot of algorithmic tasks on IT lessons and even started to sell my helping hand to another students for some cheap price. Now I'm trying to receive a new profession in my new college and RS School courses. I think my desire to learn will help me to pass and to success!

## Code Example: 

### Disemvowel Trolls

**DESCRIPTION:** *Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".*
**Solution:**
```javascript
function disemvowel(str) {
  str = str.replace(/[aoeiu]/gi, '')
  return str;
}
```
